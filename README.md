# Calculating Population Change Over Time Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used just R to build the project. I analyzed a simple data chart to gain a better understanding and insight of the year and population growth from 1927 to 2017 in Istanbul, Turkey.
 
### Results:

**Original Data**

First I created the variables called *city_name*, *pop_year_one* and *pop_year_two*.

Then I used the variables to perform calculations.

Afterwards, I called the function with the correct arguments.

Finally, I created the function named *calculate_annual_growth* and the variable  *annual_growth* to analyze the data. In addition, I created a message variable to display the calculations. Then print the *message* and return the *annual_growth*.

After analyzing the data, I was able to gleam that from 1927 to 2017 the population of Istanbul, Turkey grew by approximately 23.0555250040199 % each year.
